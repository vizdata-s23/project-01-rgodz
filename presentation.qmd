## Introduction

-   Our investigation utilizes FIFA World Cup data including two datasets titled `matches` and `wc`

-   The `matches` dataset includes data from every World Cup game from 1930 - 2018 and its variables reflect which teams played in a match and its outcome

-   The `wc` dataset includes general information about each individual World Cup with variables like tournament host, year, and which nations placed first through fourth

## Question 1: How has aggregate goal count per match changed over time, and does the round in which a match is played correlate with this metric?

## Goals per match over time

```{r}
#| label: q1-pres-1
#| echo: false

  filter(stage != "Third place") |> #Third place game dropped from analysis due to teams lacking competitive edge

    stage = if_else(
      str_detect(stage, "Group"),
      "Group Stage",
      if_else(str_detect(stage, "Final"), "Final", stage)
    ),
    total_score = home_score + away_score
  ) |>
  mutate(year_group = if_else(
    year <= 1962,
    "1930 - 1962",
    if_else(year <= 1990, "1966 - 1990", "1994-2018")
  ))

    subtitle = "By time period",
    x = "Tournament Stage",
    y = "Mean goals per match",
    fill = "Tournament Stage"
  )
```

## Discussion

-   It is challenging to discern any concrete trends as far as goal tally having a strong relationship with tournament stage

-   Goals per match seem to be most consistent in the `Group stage` (2 to 3 goals per match) which makes sense given it sees the highest amount of matches

-   Overall, it seems that goals per match have declined over time with countries recently becoming more conservative in later rounds

## Question 2: Over the course of the FIFA World Cup's tenure, which nations have had the most success aggregated across all tournaments from 1930 to 2018 when considering semi-final appearances and overall goal differential?

## Power rankings: semifinal appearances

```

## Discussion

-   The first plot shows that the overall trend is that total goal differential and final four appearances are highly correlated

-   Our analysis of our second research question has given us insight into which teams consistently perform the best in the history of the World Cup, that being Brazil, Hungary, and Mexico.
